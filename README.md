# House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques Walkthrough

This project has been done for a Kaggle competition. 

**Kaggle** is a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions in which statisticians and data miners compete to produce the best models for predicting and describing the datasets uploaded by companies and users.

##### Selected project to this assignment
- House Prices; Advanced Regression Techniques
- Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques 

##### Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges us to predict the final price of each home.

Methodology
----------------
- Selected Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Used Technologies:
